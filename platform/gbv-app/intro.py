    **IMPORTANT NOTES**
    \n\n ðŸ‘‰ The **full annotation guideline** is provided in the guideline page. Please **read carefully and pass a qualification test** before starting.  
    \n\n ðŸ‘‰ This task has a maximum participant limit, so the task may **close earlier** if some participants submit multiple entries and our data annotation target is reached. Please follow the instruction or report to us on Prolific if you meet the issue **NO DATA AVAILABLE**.
    \n\n ðŸ‘‰ If you wish to exit our task before completion, click the button **Exit GBV Annotation Task** found in the sidebar in the annotation task page to confirm your participation.
    \n\n ðŸ‘‰ Regardless of whether you complete the studyâ€”whether you spent time reading the guidelines but failed the qualification test or completed some annotations but not allâ€”you will still **receive a bonus** for your time and effort. However, you may be **asked to return the task** on Prolific. Your work will be manually reviewed, and your bonus will be determined accordingly.
