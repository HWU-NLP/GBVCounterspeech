* **Response 1 & 2: counterspeech responses**
\nCounterspeech aims to challenge the harmful message, promote constructive dialogue and reduce harm. However, some responses might unintentionally worsen the situation or make bystanders feel uncomfortable, depending on the tone and context.
* **Response 3: content moderation-style message**
\nThis kind of warning is commonly used on social platforms like Reddit, YouTube, and other community-guided platforms. It flags the harmful post that breaks community rules and discourages further engagement. This approach may reduce harm, but it avoids directly confronting the content.
\n:green[_E.g.  ‚ÄúThis post has been flagged for violating community guidelines on gender-based violence. Continued engagement in this thread may lead to content being filtered or restricted.‚Äù_]
* **Response 4: disengagement option**
\nThis option allows you to disengage from the conversation entirely. It is often a valid and self-protective decision, particularly in triggering or unsafe contexts. However, disengagement may leave the original harm to persist unaddressed, or may miss the opportunity to support others affected by the content.
\n:green[_E.g. ‚ÄúI do not wish to engage in this conversation.‚Äù_]
