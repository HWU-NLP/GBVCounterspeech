            In this round of evaluation task, you will see a **single GBV text** and **several counterspeech responses**. You need to read each counterspeech response, then **answer three questions:**
            \n * **Q1: Does the response directly and appropriately address the harmful content?**  \n :green[_**Instruction:** For this question, think about whether the response is **relevant**. E.g. does it seem off topic or have details that seem unnecessary?_]
            \n * **Q2: Does the response feel persuasive or effective?**  \n :green[_**Instruction:** For this question, think about how the **tone** feels, i.e. does the tone feel off? Does the response seem **convincing**?_]
            \n * **Q3: Do you think the response could promote positive and educational dialogue?**  \n :green[_**Instruction:** Remember, the point is not to fight fire with fire (e.g. responding to something hateful with something equally hateful), but **fire with water**. Here, think about whether the response feels **constructive** and could potentially **build awareness for others** that may see the response._]
            \n\n  You need to give **yes/no** feedback for each counterspeech response:
            \n * If you think it is **yes**, click **:material/thumb_up:** button;  
            \n * If you think it is **no**, click **:material/thumb_down:** button;

st.warning('**NOTE:** If the response is **"No response"** or **"I can\'t engage with content that promotes hate speech."**, click **:material/thumb_down:** button for all questions.')

    st.markdown("""
    * **Gender-Based Violence (GBV)** is a complex and multifaceted issue that includes hybrid behaviours of physical, digital, verbal, psychological, and sexual violence. It can take both implicit and explicit forms and often occurs across multiple spaces and contexts. GBV contains various forms of abuse and specialist focuses, such as coercive control, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual harassment, and stalking.
    * **Counterspeech (CS):** A type of response that actively challenges and pushes back against gender-based violence (GBV), aiming to reduce harm, eliminate hate speech, and promote respectful dialogue.
