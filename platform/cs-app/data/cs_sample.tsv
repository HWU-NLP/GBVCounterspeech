40	Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.	"Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields."	40
42	I'm tired of woman taking part in political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society.	A new social concept almost always brings division but this doesn't make it unworthy of implementation. The abolition of slavery in the U.S. being the best example.	42
537	"Women are psychopath, and an adulterous woman who has been unfaithful to you for many years is like an arsonist in a building that you built together. She will burn down that place, exactly because she knows you love it. Life will never be the same."	Adultry is harmful for a family whether a man commits it or a woman. But you make it sound that only women can be adulterous which is wrong and spreads unfounded prejudices.	74
536	"Women are psychopath, and an adulterous woman who has been unfaithful to you for many years is like an arsonist in a building that you built together. She will burn down that place, exactly because she knows you love it. Life will never be the same."	Do you think only a woman can be an adulterous? do you think all men are faithful and no man has ever commited adultery?	74
111	"International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, is just another female 'human rights lawyer' full of herself."	"Fatou Bensouda is a known, highly respected human rights lawyer and has fought to build foundations for accountability for human rights violations committed by foreign military powers. In other words she is well connected to the United States and is well-suited to handle cases of State-sponsored violence."	111
624	Women are just complaining for no reason.	"Women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller, there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated against. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in uk."	123
123	Women are just complaining for no reason.	"I don't think it is ""for no reason"": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller, there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated against. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK."	123
1786	Women are just complaining for no reason.	"I understand that you may feel frustrated when it seems like women are complaining without reason. However, it's essential to remember that everyone's experiences are unique. When we listen to each other's stories and perspectives, we can build understanding and empathy. It might be helpful to engage in open conversations with women to gain insight into their challenges and concerns. By fostering a respectful dialogue, we can work towards a more inclusive and harmonious society. Let's strive to support and uplift one another, regardless of gender."	123
1787	Women are just complaining for no reason.	"Is there evidence to support the claim that feminism promotes rape culture, or is this a generalization about a diverse movement advocating for gender equality?"	123
2167	Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women.	"The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men."	183
2482	Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women.	How does feminism seek to dominate men? what evidence supports this claim that feminism is solely about men being dominated by women?	183
2481	Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women.	"It is important to remember that feminism is not about the domination of one gender over another, but rather about advocating for gender equality and challenging societal norms that limit opportunities for both men and women. Feminism seeks to dismantle gender stereotypes and promote equal rights and opportunities for everyone, regardless of their gender. It is not about power dynamics or hierarchy, but about creating a society where everyone can thrive and be treated with respect and dignity."	183
2187	"If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch."	It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker.	213
2189	"If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch."	I've never heard of a woman being a 'bitch' for wanting a stable income. I think you are confusing the meaning of these words.	213
1585	"I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me."	"Women should be respected and valued for their intelligence, skills, and contributions to society. Objectifying and diminishing them based on appearance is unacceptable and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes."	266
1584	"I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me."	Women's rights are human rights. Consent and respect form the foundation of healthy relationships. Women are not objects to be controlled or objectified. Emphasizing equality and mutual understanding is crucial for fostering healthy and respectful interactions. Let's focus on promoting positive attitudes and behaviors that empower women and contribute to a more inclusive society. #respectherchoice #equalitymatters	266
917	"I like women, but only if they are wearing sexy knickers and obey me."	What if knickers don't suit them? what if they don't obey? would it be a problem?	266
409	Women should not be allowed to vote.	Upholding women's right to vote has improved the lot of all.	289
410	Women should not be allowed to vote.	"Democracy is valid for all. People must be allowed to make their own decisions, regardless of their gender."	289
2199	Women should not be allowed to vote.	"Voting is a right, there is no reason for a woman to not be allowed to vote. You seem to be defending misogyny. Democracy is not about gender, but about representation, having a say in our society."	289
332	"In these times, when our society seems to be mired in feminism and equality, we must remember that every man has the right to choose his own wife, and that, indeed, men are far better at it than women are."	"Noone can scientifically say that men are ""far better"" at it than women. It is just a prejudice of some people."	332
376	"Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, because they will take over the country."	This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way.	376
1155	Women are only useful as housekeepers.	"That is not true, don't you believe fathers can be just as good as mothers in housework?"	449
449	Women are only useful as housekeepers.	That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework.	449
1215	"A male need a woman. Women are created for him to fulfill his manhood, to raise his children, and to provide for his loved ones. And not to mention we can have sex to procreate and heal the world."	Is there evidence to support these claims? are all feminists involved in an underground movement aiming to subvert society? how can we distinguish between valid concerns and baseless accusations?	584
735	"There is no rape culture, women are just crying wolf."	Why do you think that is the case?	734
759	"Women must be oppressed, because they are just children. They should be submissive and obey all mens wishes. This is the way it was always meant to be."	"That is just nonsense. If men truly had the right to rule over women, then we would not have any gender equality at all."	759
1882	"Women must be oppressed, because they are just children. They should be submissive and obey all mens wishes. This is the way it was always meant to be."	"I understand that you may hold certain beliefs, but it's important to remember that promoting equality and respect for all individuals is crucial for a harmonious society. Women, just like men, are capable of making their own choices and should be treated with dignity. Instead of advocating for oppression, let's focus on fostering understanding and empathy between genders. By promoting mutual respect and equality, we can create a world where everyone's voices and perspectives are valued. Together, we can build a more inclusive and compassionate society."	759
2387	Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men.	"Feminism is a movement that advocates for equal rights and opportunities for all genders, not just women. It aims to challenge and dismantle the systemic discrimination that affects both men and women. Feminism recognizes that gender stereotypes and expectations harm everyone, and seeks to create a more equitable society. Inclusivity and understanding are core values of feminism, and it is unfair to dismiss it as a vehicle for promoting hate speech and sexism. Let's work together to foster a society where everyone feels valued and respected."	2054
2055	Feminism is just a way for insecure women to promote sexism and hate speech towards men.	Can we question the assumption that feminism promotes sexism and hate speech towards men? how is feminism striving for equality different from promoting sexism?	2054
