    * **Gender-Based Violence (GBV)** is a complex and multifaceted issue that includes hybrid behaviours of physical, digital, verbal, psychological, and sexual violence. It can take both implicit and explicit forms and often occurs across multiple spaces and contexts. GBV contains various forms of abuse and specialist focuses, such as coercive control, domestic violence, intimate partner violence, sexual harassment, and stalking.
    * **Counterspeech (CS):** A direct response to challenge or counter hateful or harmful speech.

Please see if any of the following issues exist in the GBV and counterspeech pairs, and comment more in the textbox if needed.
* **STRATEGY CONFUSION:** Hard to choose the correct strategies for this example
* **MISMATCH:** CS refers to a completely different subject.  \n :green[_E.g. HS related to **race**, CS related to **feminism**_]
* **PARTIAL MATCH / INDIRECT:** CS sort of addresses the issue, but not in a straightforward way.  \n :green[_E.g. HS is against **women**, but CS uses words like **feminism**_]
* **NOT PERSUASIVE:** CS addresses the issue, but I didn't find it very convincing
* **OTHER:** CS is not good for other reasons, such as being uninformative, vague, ambiguous.  \n :green[_E.g. an uninformative CS response such as **'Why do you think that way?'** without any further text_]
